# Experiments

Our team trained and tested the following models before narrowing down on the best performer:
- VGG-19: [Training](/notebooks/experiments/smartathon-training-vgg19.ipynb) & [Testing](/notebooks/experiments/smartathon-training-vgg19.ipynb)
- VGG-16
- InceptionNet
- XceptionNet
- ResNet50V2
- EfficientNetB4

All of the above models were built using the Keras Application API as used in VGG-19.
