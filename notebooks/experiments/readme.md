# Experiments

Our team trained and tested the following models before narrowing down on the best performer:
- VGG-19: [Training](/notebooks/experiments/smartathon-training-vgg19.ipynb) & [Testing](/notebooks/experiments/smartathon-training-vgg19.ipynb)
- VGG-16
- InceptionNet
- XceptionNet
- ResNet50V2
- EfficientNetB4

All of the above models were built using the Keras Application API as used in VGG-19. 

Some other models that were open-sourced are:
- [YOLOv7](/notebooks/experiments/YOLOv7_Smartathon.ipynb)
- [YOLOv5 with Focal Loss](/notebooks/experiments/Yolov5_with_focal_loss.ipynb)
- [FastRCNN](/notebooks/experiments/samrtathon-fastrcnn.ipynb)
- [Faster RCNN with Resnet101 Backbone](/notebooks/experiments/faster-rcnn-resnet101.ipynb)
- [Fast RCNN with Detectron](/notebooks/experiments/fastrcnn_detectron2.ipynb)
